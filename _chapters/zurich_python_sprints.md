We are a group of programmers based in Zürich who are passionate about making open-source projects better.
We believe in sharing our skills for free to earn our good karma. If you are devoted to a particular open source project, please let us know, we could make a sprint dedicated to it!
Inclusion is in the nature of our group and we want to make sure that no one is underrepresented. All people are welcome.
Our group was founded in February 2023.
